SCAMSHIELD: A GAMIFIED CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS APPLICATION FOR DIGITAL BANKING SECURITY IN NIGERIA

ABSTRACT
The rise of digital banking in Nigeria has led to increased convenience for users but has also made them juicy targets for scammers. Despite efforts by financial institutions to enhance security, the weakest link remains the end-users, often vulnerable due to ignorance, lack of up-to-date information, and or inadequate awareness on how they can avoid, prevent, and mitigate these scam techniques. This study introduces ScamShield, an interactive gamified mobile application designed to address this gap by educating users about digital banking scams through interactive scenarios. By utilizing gamification elements such as quizzes, rewards, and real-life scenarios, ScamShield helps users identify and respond to threats while promoting safer banking practices. The application aims to empower users, particularly those aged 15-40, by providing engaging and practical experiences that improve their cybersecurity awareness and behavior. This project represents a critical step toward enhancing digital banking security in Nigeria by focusing on continuous learning and adapting to evolving threats.
